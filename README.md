# Text_classification
The repository  involves clasification of text as either spam or not spam., a technique that is commonly used in Gmail in filtering the messages which are spam

Various steps in building the model includes, 

-data loading 

-data analysis and exploration 

-Feature engineering( count  vectorization to convert text to  numerical)

-model building and  evaluation

Still i have used sklearn pipeline to simplify the code using a simple API
